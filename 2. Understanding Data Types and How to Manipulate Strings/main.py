# TODO: Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# NOTE: Do not change the code on line 24. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

# TOPIC 4: Mathematical operations
# print(8 + 2)
# print(8 - 2)
# print(8 * 2)
# print(9 / 2)
# print(9 // 2)
# print(8 ** 2)

# NOTE: BMI = weight / (height * height)

# TODO: Create a program using maths and f-strings that tells us how many weeks we have left until pension.
# NOTE: It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format: "You have _ weeks left until pension."

# TODO: Kate needs a very simple tip calculator for whenever she goes to eat in a restaurant. In her country, it's usual to tip 15%.
# NOTE. Output a message in this format: "The bill was _, the tip was _, and the total value _."
# Task 1. Calculate the tip. Create a variable called tip for this.
# Task 2. Log a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip).

# HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
