We're not always going to be working with lists and using for loops. 
Sometimes we might want to use a loop completely independent of a list.

Good example of this is when Carl Gauss (picture #2), the German mathematician, When he was just a child (10 years old),
his math teacher gave him an exercise that she probably thought would tie him up for it a little while.
And the idea was to get him to add all of the numbers from 1 to 100. So 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5, et cetera, all the way until a hundred.

And even though she thought: "This would keep him busy for an hour or so, getting this young child to add up these numbers, and I can have some peace and quiet", but unfortunately he came back to her within two minutes and gave her the answer. 

So how did he work it out? Well, here's actually a really smart kid and he figured out that if you flip the
numbers around (picture #3), and you'll look at both of these two lines, you can see that 1 + 100 = 101, 2 + 99 = 101, 3 + 98 = 101.
If you tie all of these numbers together, there's actually 50 pairs of 101. So he could simply just do 50 multiplied by 101 which is 5050.

And that's how he figured out the answer.

But we can actually outshine Gaus because we can do this calculation in lessthan a minute, just by writing a few lines of code.
